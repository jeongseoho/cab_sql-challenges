'10 Days of SQL' challenge in Code Academy Berlin For the next two weeks, we will be completing the '10 Days of SQL' challenge. As we've seen earlier, SQL is a need-to-know skill for Data Analysts and having a good command of it highers the chances of being hired. All types of companies, from Facebook and Google to a small bike store, use it to manage their data, making SQL an industry standard. The main goal of these exercises is for you to deepen and practice SQL skills, not to complete them all. Take into consideration there is always more than one way to solve them. So be curious and happy coding!
